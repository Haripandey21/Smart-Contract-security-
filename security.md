## Overview
```bash
OVERVIEW : 
** While blockchain technology is gaining traction, there are potential attacks. For instance, there are currently
emerging DeFi attacks; exchange hacks, among others. However, all blockchain-related attacks are not smart contract attacks.
Some are defraud, malicious, and weak protocol attacks.
The Attack Classification ::ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘

The attacks on smart contract security and blockchain, in general, can be classified into four basic categories.
These categories include

1. malicious attacks: Crypto-jacking, slack, and forum attack

2. weak protocol :  the different protocols are prone to one attack or the other. Some of those attacks are 51% attacks, 
                  Sybill attacks, 34% attack, and denial of service.
                  An Eclipse attack can occur in the same vein to manipulate the peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
                  
3. defraud : Defraud can trick a merchant into releasing his goods before the confirmation of a transaction. 
             In a practical sense, a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed after six transactions.a consumer may try to persuade a merchant to 
             release goods without waiting for up to 6 transactions, so attack techniques like one confirmation or no confirmation 
             can be initiated to double spend.

4. application bugs :  It arises when smart contract developers fail to see code errors in the decentralized application. 
                        An attacker can drain all the money from the smart contract wallet through simple code bugs. Hence, the need 
                        for smart contract audits.
